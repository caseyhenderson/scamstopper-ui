# Scamstopper-UI

This is the repository for the Scamstopper web application, which can be found at https://river-cocoa-377215.web.app/. The repository for the chatbot itself can be found at https://github.com/caseyhenderson/ScamstopperFYP . 

## To Use
Simply navigate to https://river-cocoa-377215.web.app/. You will notice that there is a button in the bottom right corner of every page - click this to open the chat window. Through this, you can converse with the Scamstopper chatbot. The 'Email Checker' feature, which takes a user-provided email and returns a prediction of whether it's a scam or not, can be accessed either via navigating to it or through asking the chatbot itself.
